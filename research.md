My research focuses on shallow surface processes that are relevant to humans. I am motivated by interesting signals, original methods, and hypothesis-based testing.

## Fiber-Optic Geophysics
I currently work on distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) which is a new form of fiber-optic sensing. More established forms of fiber-optic geophysics include distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and distributed strain sensing (DSS),

### Permafrost thaw dynamics and infrastructure hazard
I have used DAS to study earthquakes at local to teleseismic distances, seismic wave propagation, anthropogenic noise sources such as vehicles and trains, and the permafrost thaw process. I have also focused on understanding the sensitivity of the DAS instrument, specifically to signals that are relevant to earth scientists (frequency=0.02 - 1 Hz), which enables application of DAS to measurements of geodetic phenomena.  which I have applied to study long-term permafrost thaw warming and permafrost degradation for the purposes of monitoring infrastructure and buildings for evolving permafrost thaw hazards.
