My research focuses on crustal process dynamics, curious signals, and emerging methodologies and tools.

## Dark Fiber-Optic Geophysics

Fiber-optic cables cover the planet and exist offshore and in urban areas. Emerging distributed fiber-optic tools are transforming these cables into dense arrays of sensors that can be used to make array measurements of acoustic, temperature, and strain fields. Our group is using these methods to study permafrost degradation in Alaska, oceanography and the seismo-acoustic coupling of the ocean and the solid earth, and seismic event detection.

**Permafrost thaw dynamics and infrastructure hazard**

I have used DAS to study earthquakes at local to teleseismic distances, seismic wave propagation, anthropogenic noise sources such as vehicles and trains, and the permafrost thaw process. I have also focused on understanding the sensitivity of the DAS instrument, specifically to signals that are relevant to earth scientists (frequency=0.02 - 1 Hz), which enables application of DAS to measurements of geodetic phenomena.  which I have applied to study long-term permafrost thaw warming and permafrost degradation for the purposes of monitoring infrastructure and buildings for evolving permafrost thaw hazards.
