[12/29/2017] Temblor post on our GRL paper and AGU poster: "Do Magnitude 7-8 mainshocks commonly trigger immediate damaging aftershocks up to 300 km away?‚Äù

[04/12/2017] Chunquan Yu receives scholarship to attend the 2017 EarthScope National Meeting. His presentation is about strong body-to-surface wave scattering recorded by the USArray. Congratulations!

[01/05/2017] EPSL paper revisiting Gutengerg-Richter law for deep earthquakes is now published online. I proposed a dual-mechanism hypothesis along with three testable predictions.

[12/13/2016] Zhongwen Zhan is awarded the Keiiti Aki Young Scientist Award in the 2016 AGU fall meeting.

[07/26/2016] Two new papers on deep earthquakes! One about the 2015  Peru deep doublet, another about recurring intermediate-depth earthquakes in Hindu Kush.

[11/09/2015] The 30 May 2015 Bonin Islands deep-focus (~680 km) earthquake is the largest ever in the Bonin slab. The Mw 7.9 earthquake was deeper than earlier seismicity by about 100 km. Rupture began with high rupture velocity then expanded with lower rupture velocity. This paper is now available on Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

[10/03/2015] New regional seismic data confirm the supershear rupture during the 24 May 2013 Mw 6.7 Okhotsk deep earthquake. This paper is now available on Geophysical Research Letters with Early-View.

[09/24/2015]  Our GRL paper about possible seasonality in large deep earthquakes is covered by New Scientist.
